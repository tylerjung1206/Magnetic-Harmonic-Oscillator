# ðŸ§² Magnetic-Harmonic-Oscillator
#
# This exploration into fundamental electromagnetic laws aims to support expected theoretical results of electromagnetic induction and utilizes a magnetic harmonic oscillator and large coil to do so. We designed and developed the physical experiment from our derived theoretical basis. We collected extensive data and utilized adaptive fit optimization and predictive modeling techniques to asses our data with theoretical results.
